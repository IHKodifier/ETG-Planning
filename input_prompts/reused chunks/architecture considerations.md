When developing the technical specification and system architecture, consider the following principles regarding architectural considerations :

- **Scalability**: Ensure the system can handle increased load by leveraging micro-services, stateless components, and horizontal scaling on both frontend (Flutter) and backend (FastAPI on AWS).
- **Fault Tolerance & Resilience**: Design for graceful degradation, implement retries, circuit breakers, and leverage AWS managed services for high availability.
- **Security**: Enforce strong authentication (AWS Cognito), secure API endpoints (API Gateway), encrypt data at rest and in transit, and follow least-privilege IAM practices.
- **Maintainability**: Use clear modular boundaries, feature-based organization, and comprehensive documentation. Favor convention over configuration where possible.
- **Performance**: Optimize for low latency and high throughput, use asynchronous processing where appropriate, and monitor with analytics (Posthog/Google Analytics).
- **Cost Efficiency**: Choose AWS services and deployment models that balance performance with cost, and monitor resource utilization.
- **Compliance & Privacy**: Ensure data handling meets regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR), especially for payments (Stripe, Paddle) and user data.
- **Observability**: Implement logging, monitoring, and alerting for all critical services. Use centralized dashboards for operational visibility.
- **Extensibility**: Architect the system to allow for easy addition of new features, integrations, and third-party services.
- **User Experience**: Ensure API design and backend performance support a responsive, reliable frontend experience in Flutter across platforms.
