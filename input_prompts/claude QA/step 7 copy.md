# Here are your serialed  answers.
1. It's a single-person team. Skill level with Flutter is good. Intermediate with Python and Firebase, and virtually no experience with FastAPI so far.
2. 3 months
3. Prioritize getting core features working locally before infrastructure, and eventually we will need to implement a CI/CD pipeline. I normally use that thing called codemagic
4. Let's use sophisticated device fingerprinting right from the start.
5. AI tutoring features should be part of phase I MVP.
6. Include steps for creating seed data and content management tools early in the process.
7. Implement all of the Google, Facebook, Phone, Email in Phase 1
8. Give me recommendations
9. Implement the complete data model upfront, keeping some room for ongoing evolution.
10. Later when monetization features are needed.
