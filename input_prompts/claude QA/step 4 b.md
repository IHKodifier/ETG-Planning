1. For the Anonymous User Welcome Flow, should the theme switcher be immediately visible on the welcome screen, or only appear after the user has made their initial choice (Continue as Guest vs Sign Up)?
2. In the Practice Mode Question Interface, when a user selects an answer, should the feedback (correct/incorrect) appear immediately, or only after they tap a "Submit Answer" button? This affects the interaction flow significantly.
3. For ARDE Probability Badges, should they be visible on every question during practice, or only in certain contexts (like filtering, post-answer explanations)? This impacts visual hierarchy.
4. In the Device Management Interface for registered users, when showing browser sessions (Chrome, Firefox, Safari), should each browser session be removable individually, or only the entire device?
5. For the Analytics Dashboard, should the charts default to showing all subjects combined, or start with a specific subject filter? This affects the initial data visualization strategy.
6. In Sprint Exam Configuration, should users see real-time question count updates as they adjust filters (subject, difficulty, ARDE probability), or only after they finalize their selections?
7. For AI Tutoring Chat Interface, should the conversation history be persistent across different questions, or should each question start a fresh conversation context?
8. When users reach their tier limits (anonymous: 20 MCQs, free: 50 MCQs), should the blocking screen appear immediately when they try to access the next question, or should there be a warning state when they have 2-3 questions remaining?

## here are your serialed answers
1. Theme switcher should be immediately visible on the welcome screen and functional. However, persistence of the selected theme mode should only be available after the user has signed up, whether it's a free user or a paid user. 
2. Let there be a "Submit answer" button to avoid accidental taps/clicks.
3. Let it be available on all questions in practice mode.
4. Combined on the entire device.
5. Default to all subjects combined with the ability to split to individual subjects when clicked.
6. Real-time count updates
7. Each question will have its own context
8. Throughout the experience, they should be able to see how many questions remain. Once they have exhausted all their limits, on the next question, they should be gracefully invited to upgrade or sign up, whatever the case may be.
