Infrastructure & Hosting Environment:

Are you planning to use Firebase Functions for all backend APIs, or will you deploy FastAPI on Google Cloud Run/App Engine alongside Firebase?
What's your preference for the FastAPI deployment model within Firebase infrastructure?


Data Architecture:

For the separate analytics database mentioned, do you want to use a second Firestore instance or BigQuery for analytics data?
What's your data retention policy for user performance metrics and practice session data?


AI Integration Strategy:

Do you have existing API keys/accounts with OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google Gemini?
What's your monthly budget expectation for AI API costs?
Should the system have a fallback AI provider if the primary one fails?


Device Management Implementation:

For web browser fingerprinting, what specific browser attributes should be tracked (screen resolution, timezone, user agent, etc.)?
Should the 85% similarity threshold for device consolidation be configurable?


Question Bank Content:

Will the initial 10,000+ questions be provided, or does the system need content generation capabilities?
What format will questions be imported in (JSON, CSV, custom format)?


Payment & Subscription:

What are the exact pricing tiers (monthly/annual costs)?
Should there be a grace period for failed payments before downgrading?


Real-time Features:

For sprint exams and real exams, should we use WebSockets or Firebase Realtime Database for live synchronization?
What's the expected concurrent user load during peak exam seasons?


Offline Capabilities:

How many questions should be cached locally for offline practice?
Should offline progress sync when returning online, or should offline be read-only?


Admin Panel Access:

Will the admin panel be a separate Flutter web app or integrated into the main app with role-based access?
How many admin/content creator roles do you need?


Deployment Strategy:

Do you want separate environments (dev, staging, production)?
What's your preferred CI/CD platform (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Firebase CI)?


Monitoring & Analytics:

Besides Google Analytics, do you want custom event tracking for learning analytics?
Should we implement error tracking (Sentry, Firebase Crashlytics)?


Regional Considerations:

Primary deployment region (given Pakistan focus)?
Do you need multi-region support for international exams (GMAT, GRE, SAT)?


Content Delivery:

Maximum file size for video explanations?
Should videos be streamed or downloadable?


Social Features Privacy:

Default privacy settings for leaderboards (opt-in or opt-out)?
Should study groups be public, private, or both?


Performance Requirements:

Target response time for API calls?
Maximum acceptable latency for real-time features?

# here are your serialed answers
1. I will use Firebase functions
2. Instead of using the second Firebase, Firestore instance, I prefer to use BigQuery. If the technical implementation of that is not very difficult, since I will be copying and pasting Firestore instances into my app. I prefer, if easy, a BigQuery instance.Performance metrics and practice session data is persisted for a user As long as the user does not delete his account.
3. I do not have API keys, although I have accounts with OpenAI and for example, Gemini. I'm not concerned about API costs as of now, and ideally I would want to have a fallback API provided in the primary one fails
4. For web browser fingerprinting, the attributes could be like:
- Screen resolution
- timezone 
- User agent
- Region and Locale Settings
- Yes TheThe 85% similarity threshold for device consolidation must be configurable via the admin panel.

5. Well, the initial 10,000 questions will be provided by the content creators, and no need for generation capabilities. Let me point out that these 10,000 questions could gro  something like upto 100,000 But certainly not in the order of millions and billions. The import  frommat is  the CSV
6. Here is how the pricing works:
- Free users get a trial period of 2 weeks with their limits already explained.
- Paid users have two options:
- They can pay monthly for their subscription for PKR 2000.
- They get a discounted annual subscription at PKR 20,000 per year.
7. I don't think using file-based real-time database is a good idea, I am using a much better firestore database which is much more capable than  real-time database . Let me know if websockets is still needed As far as I know, firestore can push real-time data to clients. I don't expect a peak  load of more than 50,000 users at a given point, but let's add for the capacity of 100,000.
8. This should be set to a maximum allowed the useer's tier limit and a maximum of 100 for the paid users who don't have a tier limit for practice questions. Offline progress should be uploaded to the database seamlessly in the background.
8.
