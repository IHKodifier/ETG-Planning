Development Team Structure: How many developers will be working on this project, and what are their skill levels with Flutter, Python/FastAPI, and Firebase?
MVP Timeline: What's your target timeline for the MVP release? This will help me prioritize features and determine if we should implement some features in phases.
Infrastructure Priority: Should I prioritize setting up the complete CI/CD pipeline and monitoring first, or focus on getting core features working locally before infrastructure?
Device Management Implementation: The spec mentions sophisticated device fingerprinting - do you want to start with a simpler device tracking approach for MVP and enhance it later, or implement the full fingerprinting system from the beginning?
AI Integration Timing: Should AI tutoring features be part of Phase 1 (MVP) or can they be delayed to Phase 2? This affects the complexity of the initial implementation.
Content Seeding: Do you have existing question bank content ready, or should I include steps for creating seed data and content management tools early in the process?
Authentication Complexity: Should we implement all authentication providers (Google, Facebook, Phone, Email) in Phase 1, or start with email/password and social auth, then add phone authentication later?
Testing Strategy Priority: What level of test coverage do you want during initial development vs. what can be added later? This affects development velocity.
Database Migration Strategy: Should I plan for gradual Firestore schema evolution or implement the complete data model upfront?
Third-party Integration Timing: When should Paddle.com payment integration be implemented - with initial user management or later when monetization features are needed?

# Here are your serialed  answers.
1. It's a single-person team. Skill level with Flutter is good. Intermediate with Python and Firebase, and virtually no experience with FastAPI so far.
2. 3 months
3. Prioritize getting core features working locally before infrastructure, and eventually we will need to implement a CI/CD pipeline. I normally use that thing called codemagic
4. Let's use sophisticated device fingerprinting right from the start.
5. AI tutoring features should be part of phase I MVP.
6. Include steps for creating seed data and content management tools early in the process.
7. Implement all of the Google, Facebook, Phone, Email in Phase 1
8. Give me recommendations
9. Implement the complete data model upfront, keeping some room for ongoing evolution.
10. Later when monetization features are needed.
