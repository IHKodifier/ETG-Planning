# first round of questions
1. What's your expected initial user load and growth trajectory over the first 12 months? This will determine our database sharding strategy and caching layers.
2. For the question bank of 10,000+ questions, do you need real-time collaborative editing capabilities for content creators, or is it a one-time bulk import with periodic updates?
3. Regarding the AI-powered follow-up Q&A system - are you planning to use OpenAI's API, build custom models, or implement a hybrid approach with pre-trained responses?
4. For the analytics service tracking performance regression, what's your acceptable data processing latency? Should insights be real-time (sub-second) or is near real-time (1-5 minutes) sufficient?
5. With multi-device synchronization (3 devices max), how should we handle offline-first capabilities on mobile vs. always-online on desktop?
6. For the simulated exam timer system, do you need millisecond precision for competitive exam compliance, or is second-level accuracy acceptable?
7. What's your budget constraint for third-party services? This affects whether we use Firebase's paid tiers vs. building custom solutions for certain features.
8. For the social accountability features, do you need real-time notifications when peers complete practice sessions, or are periodic updates sufficient?---

# Answers
1.we dont envisage a maximum user base of 50,000 users at any point 
2.initially a  bulk upload from a csv Do most of the lifting, and then we will use an interface to do the fine-tuning to the question and update URLs after we have uploaded any images if required.
3.No pre-trained custom models, instead we will use OpenAI's API or any of the other models out there like Gemini, Anthropic, Mistral, Grok.
4.Under one minute.
5.This app is primarily an online app, and no offline features.
6.A second-level accuracy is acceptable.
7.We shall be able to afford  firebase's paid  tiers once we have enough users. Financing and budget should not be an issue.
8.Real-time notifications would be great because they will keep the users encouraged to visit the app repeatedly.
