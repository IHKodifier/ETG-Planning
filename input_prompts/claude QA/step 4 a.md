1. Color Preference: I see a sophisticated color palette with deep greens, golds, and burgundy. Would you like me to use this exact palette as the foundation, or would you prefer a different direction that better represents academic excellence and exam preparation?  
2. Target Platform Priority: Should the style guide prioritize mobile-first design (given Flutter is primary) or desktop-first, and how important is cross-platform visual consistency vs. platform-specific conventions?
3. Tier Differentiation: How should the visual design differentiate between anonymous, free, and paid user experiences - through subtle UI variations, color coding, or distinct interface elements?
4. ARDE Probability Visualization: For the critical ARDE probability feature (High >70%, Medium 30-70%, Low 0-30%), do you have preferences for how these should be visually represented (badges, color coding, icons, etc.)?
5. Analytics Dashboard Complexity: Given the comprehensive analytics features, should the style guide lean toward data-heavy dashboards with dense information or simplified, digestible visualizations?
6. Accessibility Requirements: Are there specific accessibility standards beyond WCAG 2.1 AA that need to be considered, particularly for the target age groups (12-18 years)?
7. Brand Personality: Should the visual tone be more academic/professional, modern/tech-forward, or approachable/friendly to reduce exam anxiety among students?
8. Iconography Style: For the extensive filtering and categorization features, would you prefer minimalist line icons, filled icons with academic themes, or a hybrid approach?

## here are your answers
1. The attached color palette is just for reference. Feel free to go in a direction that is more suited towards academic excellence and exam preparation.
2. Let's start with a target platform as mobile first, but we need our app on mobiles, tablets, and desktops.As a matter of fact, when it comes to coding, I would like to code the web desktop first and then the mobile versions.  
3. How about using three slightly different but identified variations of the primary color to signify the free user, anonymous user, and paid users? I am open to your suggestions on this one.
4. Badges seem to be a good option for such for this ARDE probability feature.
5. Simplified, digestible visualization yet comprehensive in nature with drill-down and on-demand details.
6. No specific guideline requirements beyond WCAG 2.1 AA 
7. a nice blend of all three i.e. academic/professional, modern/tech-forward, and approachable/friendly 
8. minimalist line icons with academic themes when inactive and filled icons with academic theme when selected/active
