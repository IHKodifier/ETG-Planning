Question Bank Management: You mention a 10,000 question bank with "slight variations." Will you be licensing existing question banks, creating original content, or sourcing questions through partnerships with educational institutions?
Exam Categories: Can you specify the exact competitive exams you're targeting initially? (e.g., JEE, NEET, SAT, specific country's medical/engineering entrance exams) This will help define the precise question formats and scoring systems.
Analytics & AI Coaching: When you mention "coaching on how to attempt questions correctly" - are you envisioning AI-generated explanations, pre-written explanations by subject experts, or video explanations? What level of personalization should the coaching provide?
User Onboarding Flow: For the exam category selection during onboarding, how granular should this be? Should users select just "Engineering" vs "Medical" or do you want specific exam types, difficulty levels, or target colleges?
Sprint Exam Definition: What exactly constitutes a "sprint exam"? Is this a time-based mini-test (e.g., 15 minutes), topic-specific test, or a reduced question count version of the full exam?
Performance Analytics Scope: Should the analytics include comparative performance against other users, percentile rankings, or focus purely on individual progress tracking?
Offline Capability: Given your target audience might have connectivity issues, do you need offline question practice capabilities?
Multi-language Support: Will the app need to support multiple languages for questions and interface, considering different regional exam requirements?
----------------------------------
here are your answers
1: the entire question bank, or most of the questions in the question bank, are publicly accessible. or sourced from various sources. When I say "variation," the variation really means changing the values of variables  or order of the variables or something like that. Slight variations basically testing the students' knowledge on the same topic or logic. 
2: SAT, GRE, GMAT,  TOEFL, Cadet Colleges Entrance  Examinations, Engineering Colleges/Medical Collerges of PakistaN are included but USMLE or PLAP are not included
3: Baically pre-written explanations/step wise approaches to the solve the problem  by subject experts, or video explanations. with follow up questions answered through AI.
4: users should select just "Engineering" / "Medical" / GRE/ GMAT/ TOEFL/SAT. after that they should be presented with a set of topic to choose from at which threy think they are weak and need to focus on. think of any other detail thst might be of help.
5: sprint exam is basically a set of back-to-back questions that the user needs to answer within a specific time frame. At the start of a sprint, a user will select how much time he has at hand to complete this sprint. It will be like he can choose from:
- Sprint of 10 questions
- Sprint of 20 questions
- Sprint of 25 questions
- Sprint of 30 questions
- Sprint of 35 questions
- Sprint of 40 questions
- Sprint of 45 questions
- Sprint of 50 questions
6:  the analytics Shouldinclude comparative performance against other users, percentile rankings, and historical record based  on individual progress tracking, particularly highlighting the questions they were good at initially, but now due to time crunch or pressure, they have been lately not doing good or doing them wrong. 
7: No offline capabilities.
8: no additional language capabilities are required. Just pure English and Maths because physics and maths will be in English. 
----------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------
9: Question Difficulty & Adaptive Learning: Should the app adjust question difficulty based on user performance, or do you want users to manually select difficulty levels? How should the system balance challenging users vs. building confidence?
10: Study Plan Implementation: You mentioned a "comprehensive study plan/improvement program" - should this be a structured multi-week curriculum with daily goals, or more of a dynamic recommendation system that suggests what to practice next?
11: Real Simulated Exam Constraints: For the full-length simulated exams, do you need to replicate the exact timing, break structure, and question distribution of each specific exam type (SAT vs GRE vs Pakistani entrance exams)? Should there be exam-specific interfaces?
12: Video Explanation Hosting: For the video explanations by subject experts, will you be creating this content in-house, partnering with educators, or sourcing from existing educational content providers?
13: Subscription Tiers: Beyond the basic paid tier, do you envision multiple subscription levels (e.g., Basic, Premium, Pro) with different feature access, or just the single paid tier?
14: Data Privacy & Regional Compliance: Given you're targeting Pakistani entrance exams and international tests, are there specific data privacy regulations (like GDPR for international users) we need to consider in the architecture?
15: Leaderboards & Social Features: Should there be any community features like leaderboards, study groups, or peer comparison beyond just percentile rankings?
16: Question Reporting: How should users report incorrect questions or suggest improvements to the question bank? Do you need a content moderation system?
-------------------------
here are your answers
9: the MCQ question bank available to the app at the back-end will have an attribute about the difficulty level of the question. Ideally, the app should have progressive difficulty with the user being able to choose from just getting the feed sweat (e.g. getting my feeds wet), going knee-deep, waist-deep, shoulder-deep, and anything similar. 
10: Yes,  multi-week curriculum with daily goals, or more of a dynamic recommendation system that suggests what to practice next with an option to time-compress the curriculum keeping in mind the actual date of the exam, so they can time-compress their preparation to be ready for the Actual/Real exam.
11: for the international exams like SAT, GRE, GMAT, TOEFL, keep the real exam structure with . For Pakistani exams, the only things are:
- Maximum time allowed
- Maximum number of questions they need to attempt
- Whether or not there is negative marking
- If there are any sections/breather breaks etc. 
12: a combination of all of creating this content in-house, partnering with educators, or sourcing from existing educational content providers
13: no basic, premium, or pro tiers - just one paid tier with an option to make savings by annual subscription or paying monthly, which will not have any discount. Each user will be limited to only three devices. 
14: no particular Data Privacy & Regional Compliance
15: users can add 5 other users to watch. Of course, they will need their consent. It's just to keep them encouraged and force them to work hard and really try to outsmart them in terms of results. But the user will have to consent to them being watched by any other user for performance. Leaded boards are not required. 
16: users can submit a question for reconsideration if they think they have attempted the right answer but the system is considering it as a wrong answer.

# Questions after project-based Claude approach.
. For the question bank of 10,000+ questions - do you plan to create this content in-house, license it from educational publishers, or crowdsource it from educators? This significantly impacts your go-to-market timeline and costs.
2. When you mention "coaching on how to attempt questions correctly" - are you envisioning AI-powered explanations, pre-written explanations by subject experts, or interactive tutoring features?
3. For the analytics tracking (time per question, answer attempts, etc.) - do you want real-time feedback during practice sessions, or only summary analytics after completion?
4. The "comprehensive study plan/improvement program" sounds like a major differentiator - should this be algorithmically generated based on performance data, or more of a structured curriculum with personalized recommendations?
5. For the "dedicated learning center with tips and tricks from masters" - are you planning video content, written guides, or interactive lessons? This affects content creation strategy and bandwidth requirements.
6. Given that ECAT/MCAT are once-yearly exams with no retakes, how do you plan to handle seasonal demand spikes and user retention during off-peak periods?
7. For the Firebase backend with FastAPI - are you planning to use Firebase Functions for the API layer, or separate hosting for your Python FastAPI services?
8. The anonymous user flow allows significant app testing before signup - have you considered how this might impact your conversion funnel and server costs?

## Here are your serial answers.
1. the entire question bank, or most of the questions in the question bank, are publicly accessible. or sourced from various sources. When I say "variation," the variation really means changing the values of variables  or order of the variables or something like that. Slight variations or flipped known and unknown variables basically testing the students' knowledge on the same topic or logic.
2. Baically pre-written explanations/step wise approaches to the solve the problem  by subject experts, or video explanations. with follow up questions answered through AI.
3. It depends on the mode the user is in:
- For practice MCQs, the answers are displayed right away .If the user's first choice selected is a wrong answer, he is given another chance. Even if the second answer is wrong, he is given a third chance. And after three wrong attempts, he is shown the right answer.
- For sprint exams, the correct answers are displayed at the end of the exam
- For simulated exams, the answers are always shown to the users at the end of the exam.  
4. multi-week curriculum with daily goals, or more of a dynamic recommendation system that suggests what to practice next with an option to time-compress the curriculum keeping in mind the actual date of the ARDE, so they can time-compress their preparation to be ready for the ARDE.
5. all of video content, written guides, or interactive lessons.
6. I am not concerned about the off-peak periods, and for the demand spikes during the seasonal. I think my backend fire waste can handle this.
7. Firebase Function can handle thisBut they have to be Python FastAPI services.

## new questions
8. Regarding anonymous users getting significant access (20 MCQs, 1 sprint exam, 1 half-length SRE) - this is quite generous. Have you validated this conversion strategy, and are you concerned about users creating multiple anonymous sessions to bypass limits?
9. For the question variations you mentioned (changing variable values, flipping known/unknown) - will this be done manually by content creators or do you want an automated system that can generate variations from base questions?
10. The multi-week curriculum with time-compression based on ARDE dates - how granular should this be? Should it account for individual learning speeds, or follow a standard pace that can be accelerated?
11. For the AI-powered follow-up questions after expert explanations - what level of sophistication are you targeting? Simple Q&A about the explanation, or more advanced tutoring that can handle conceptual discussions?
12. You mention Google Analytics for app analytics, but you're also tracking detailed performance metrics (time per question, attempts, etc.). Should these detailed learning analytics be stored separately from general app usage analytics?
13. With Stripe for payments and Paddle for subscription management - is there a specific reason for using both? Typically one platform handles the entire payment flow.
14. For the "tips and tricks from masters" content - do you have identified subject matter experts already, or is this content that needs to be sourced and created?
15. Given that Firebase Functions have timeout limitations, have you considered which operations might need to run longer (like generating comprehensive performance reports) and how to handle those?

## Here are your serial answers.
8. Here is my conversion strategy
- After an anonymous user has exhausted his entire limit, he will be required to sign up at least on the free plan to start enjoying free plan usage limits.
- After a free plan user has exhausted all his usage limit, he will be required to sign up for a paid plan. The free plan is available for two weeks only after which the user will have to upgrade to a paid plan, no matter if they have exhausted their entire usage limit or not.
9. The question bank will have these variations hard-coded into the database for each primary question out of the question bank.Plus the content creators will be constantly updating these variations of the primary question.The analytics on each question will help us create variations for the questions that have been presented to the user the most.
10. The time-compressed learning plans will not be curated in the MVP at least. For the MVP, we will follow a standard pace that can be accelerated based on the time available for the ARDE.
11. More advanced tutoring in addition to simple Q&A questions that can handle conceptual discussions.
12. Yes, the user performance metrics should be stored separately from the app usage analytics.
13.Actually, it was a mistake on my part. paddle.com will manage both subscriptions and payments.
14. The content for tips and tricks for masters will be sourced and created by the content creators.
15. I don't envisage any long-running operations, but nonetheless, we'll be using cloud-side functions to do the heavy lifting.
