# questions  
1:Target User Prioritization: Among your user segments (high school graduates 17-19, college graduates 21-25, young students 13-15, graduate students 22-26), which segment should we prioritize for the initial MVP launch to focus our feature stories most effectively?  

2: Sprint Session Complexity: For the Adaptive Sprint Examination System, what's the intended balance between quick practice sessions (10 questions) versus comprehensive exam simulations (50+ questions) in terms of user engagement and learning effectiveness?  

3: AI Coaching Scope: In the AI-Powered Coaching system, should the AI conversations be limited to explanation clarifications, or should they extend to study planning, motivation, and broader academic coaching?  

4: Social Features Privacy: For the Social Accountability system, what level of performance detail should be shareable between peers - just overall scores, subject-wise breakdowns, or granular question-level analytics?  
5: Monetization Strategy: Between subscription tiers and ad-supported free usage, which revenue model should be the primary focus for user acquisition and retention in your initial market?  

6: Cross-Platform Synchronization: For the Multi-Device Session Management, should user progress and sprint sessions sync in real-time across devices, or is it acceptable to have device-specific progress with periodic synchronization?  

7:Analytics Depth: In the Real-Time Analytics system, should performance regression detection focus on topic-level analysis or drill down to specific question types and difficulty patterns?  

8: Content Management: For the Question Bank Management, will content creation be primarily admin-driven, or should there be community contribution features where verified educators can submit questions?

# here are your answers
1. High school graduates
2. A sprint examination is a sort of mini comprehensive exam simulation. The purpose is to make the users accustomed to sustained pressure over a longer period of time or for a prolonged number of questions.The UI is more or less similar to sprint exam with features like timekeeping, but the complexity of the questions adapts to the user's current learning curve or the topic he has covered so far. 
3. Conversations are not limited to explanation and clarification but also include components like:
- Study planning
- Motivation
- Broad academic coaching
4.Overall scores, subject-wise breakdowns, and granular question-level analytics.
5.Paid subscriptions is the primary monetization strategy, with ads designed to boost revenue and generate revenue from anonymous and free users as well.
6.Only user progress needs to sync in real-time across devices, and we don't need to real-time sync the sprint exams. Sprint exams  or simulated real exams must be completed on the same device as the one they started on . They cannot be transferred to other devices.
8.For the question bank management, content creation will be primarily admin-driven. But the students can report a question if they feel their answer is correct but it has been wrongly recorded in the question bank.

# additional questions
9. Performance Regression Analytics: When the system detects that a student's performance has declined in a specific topic, what types of interventions should be automatically triggered - additional practice recommendations, difficulty adjustments, or coaching notifications?    

10. Exam Simulation Authenticity: For the Simulated Exam Environment, should the system replicate the exact question distribution and timing of real exams (like ECAT having 200 questions in 210 minutes), or provide flexibility for custom exam lengths?  

11. Question Reporting Workflow: When students report potentially incorrect questions, should this trigger an immediate review process, temporarily flag the question for other users, or simply queue it for admin review without affecting the live question pool?
12. Social Accountability Notifications: For peer monitoring, what frequency and types of notifications would maintain motivation without becoming intrusive - daily progress summaries, milestone achievements, or real-time activity updates?
13. Adaptive Difficulty Progression: In your five-level difficulty system, should the progression be automatic based on performance thresholds, or should students have manual control to challenge themselves at higher levels?
14. Study Plan Personalization: Should the AI coaching system generate study plans based solely on performance analytics, or should it also consider external factors like exam dates, available study hours per day, and student-declared weak subjects?
15. Free vs Premium Features: Which core features should remain accessible to free users to drive adoption, and which premium features would provide the strongest conversion incentive for high school students?

## Here are your answers. Feel free to ask additional questions if you need to.
9. Additional practice recommendations and coaching notifications.Do not adjust the difficulty of upcoming questions since the student needs to excel in those questions for the real exam.
10. Exact replica of the exam format.You also need to take into account how the exact format of the exams will be recorded and updated in the app.
11. Work out a thorough workflow to report wrong questions.
 They will have to be reviewed by the admin, If the user reporting is correct, the question is to be immediately notified to all app users via notification so they take  note of the correct answer to the question. The user reporting should be rewarded with a slight increase in their limits.
 12. For social accountability, a user can create a group of consenting users who would want to share their progress with them. The frequency should not be very high but just enough to keep the user motivated and keep an eye on his group of fellow students, fellow users so that he/she remains motivated and keeps visiting the app.
 13. Students should have manual control to challenge themselves at higher levels. Once they feel comfortable at a certain level, they can ask for being treated at the higher level. This also tells me that we should have a user profile management subsystem in which they can share their name, age, gender, and educvational institution they are coming from.
 14. One of the prime objectives of the study plan personalization is that students can time-compress their preparation in view of the remaining days left for the exam. Their plans should be generated based on performance analytics as well as factors like exam dates and study hourse they need to put in daily tofully  prepare for the exam on the given date and student declaration of the topics or subjects they feel they are weak at.. In addition, there should be a set of pre-built plans like:
 - crash prep  72 hrs
 - crash prep 48 hrs
 - crash prep 24 hrs
 - 7-day prep
- 10-day prep
- 15-day prep
- 21-day prep
15. Daily Practice MCQs:
- A total of four sprint exams for the trial period of two weeks
- A half-length full simulated exam during the trial period for premium users
