Before creating the specification:

1\. \*\*Analyze the project comprehensively\*\* in \<brainstorm\> tags, considering:  
  \- System architecture and infrastructure requirements  
  \- Core functionality and feature breakdown  
  \- Data models and storage architecture  
  \- API and integration specifications  
  \- Security, privacy, and compliance requirements  
  \- Performance and scalability considerations  
  \- User interface and experience specifications  
  \- Third-party services and external dependencies  
  \- Deployment and operational requirements  
  \- Quality assurance and monitoring strategy

2\. \*\*For each area, ensure you\*\*:  
  \- Provide detailed breakdown of requirements and implementation approaches  
  \- Identify potential challenges, risks, and mitigation strategies  
  \- Consider edge cases, error scenarios, and recovery mechanisms  
  \- Propose alternative solutions where applicable

3\. \*\*Critical considerations\*\*:  
  \- Break down complex features into detailed user flows and system interactions  
  \- Identify areas requiring clarification or having technical constraints  
  \- Consider platform-specific requirements (web, mobile, desktop)  
  \- Address non-functional requirements (performance, security, accessibility)

  \- Provide concrete examples and clear interfaces between components  
  \- Include specific implementation guidance without unnecessary jargon  
  \- Focus on completeness and actionability for development teams  
  \- Consider both technical and business constraints

5\. **\*\*Project structure guidelines\*\*** (adapt based on technology stack): \- Prefer feature-based organization over layer-based when possible \- Group related functionality together (e.g., components, hooks, utilities for a feature) \- Separate concerns clearly (business logic, UI, data access) \- Consider these common patterns: \- \`/features\` or \`/modules\` for feature-based grouping \- \`/shared\` or \`/common\` for cross-cutting concerns \- \`/lib\` or \`/utils\` for utilities and helpers \- \`/services\` for external integrations \- Document the chosen structure rationale in the specification \- Include example directory trees for complex features 

6\. **\*\*When specifying project structure\*\***: \- Show concrete examples with file paths \- Explain the reasoning for the chosen organization \- Highlight where shared code should live \- Indicate naming conventions (camelCase, PascalCase, kebab-case) \- Specify file naming patterns (e.g., \`\*.test.ts\`, \`\*.spec.ts\`)

${design_considerations} = "
When developing the technical specification and system architecture, consider the following design principles:

- **Scalability**: Ensure the system can handle increased load by leveraging micro-services, stateless components, and horizontal scaling on both frontend (Flutter) and backend (FastAPI on AWS).
- **Fault Tolerance & Resilience**: Design for graceful degradation, implement retries, circuit breakers, and leverage AWS managed services for high availability.
- **Security**: Enforce strong authentication (AWS Cognito), secure API endpoints (API Gateway), encrypt data at rest and in transit, and follow least-privilege IAM practices.
- **Maintainability**: Use clear modular boundaries, feature-based organization, and comprehensive documentation. Favor convention over configuration where possible.
- **Performance**: Optimize for low latency and high throughput, use asynchronous processing where appropriate, and monitor with analytics (Posthog/Google Analytics).
- **Cost Efficiency**: Choose AWS services and deployment models that balance performance with cost, and monitor resource utilization.
- **Compliance & Privacy**: Ensure data handling meets regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR), especially for payments (Stripe, Paddle) and user data.
- **Observability**: Implement logging, monitoring, and alerting for all critical services. Use centralized dashboards for operational visibility.
- **Extensibility**: Architect the system to allow for easy addition of new features, integrations, and third-party services.
- **User Experience**: Ensure API design and backend performance support a responsive, reliable frontend experience in Flutter across platforms.

Document all key design decisions, trade-offs, and rationale in the technical specification.
- **Bold simplicity**: Prioritize clean layouts with minimal distractions, focusing on essential elements.
- **Breathable whitespace**: Use generous spacing to create clarity and reduce cognitive load.
- **Strategic negative space** calibrated for cognitive breathing room and content prioritization  
- **Strategic color theory**: Apply a limited palette with purposeful accent colors for hierarchy and action cues.
- **Typography hierarchy**: Employ clear font scaling and weight variance for information architecture.
- **Visual density optimization**: Balance information availability with ease of scanning.
- **Motion choreography**: Use subtle, physics-based transitions for spatial continuity and feedback.
- **Accessibility-driven contrast**: Ensure all color choices meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards for contrast and legibility.
- **Consistent affordances**: Make interactive elements visually distinct and intuitive.
- **Feedback responsiveness**: Provide immediate, clear feedback for user actions and system status.
- **Content-first layouts**: Organize screens to prioritize user goals and primary tasks.
- **Progressive disclosure**: Reveal complexity only as needed to avoid overwhelming users.
- **Platform conventions**: Respect established iOS/Android/Web patterns for familiarity.
- **Responsive design**: Guarantee usability across all device sizes and orientations.
- **Microcopy and content strategy**: Use concise, helpful text to guide users.
- **Aesthetic appeal**: Maintain a visually pleasing, brand-aligned look while prioritizing usability.
