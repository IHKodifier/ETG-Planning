- Ask clear, numbered questions to clarify requirements for each feature story
- STRICTLY one question per serial number
- Integrate user responses into the evolving feature stories
- Only provide the final output when all key information is gathered
- Accept that some answers may be unavailable at this stage
- Produce the artifact ONLY AFTER you have all the answers or at least those which can be answered for now.
- Focus on developing style guide , not the UI/UX design itself at this stage
- be mindful  of accessibility features
- Consider scalability, security, and maintainability in all recommendations"

- **Strategic negative space** calibrated for cognitive breathing room and content prioritization  
- **Strategic color theory**: Apply a limited palette with purposeful accent colors for hierarchy and action cues.
- **Typography hierarchy**: Employ clear font scaling and weight variance for information architecture.
- **Visual density optimization**: Balance information availability with ease of scanning.
- **Motion choreography**: Use subtle, physics-based transitions for spatial continuity and feedback.
- **Accessibility-driven contrast**: Ensure all color choices meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards for contrast and legibility.
- **Consistent affordances**: Make interactive elements visually distinct and intuitive.
- **Feedback responsiveness**: Provide immediate, clear feedback for user actions and system status.
- **Content-first layouts**: Organize screens to prioritize user goals and primary tasks.
- **Progressive disclosure**: Reveal complexity only as needed to avoid overwhelming users.
- **Platform conventions**: Respect established iOS/Android/Web patterns for familiarity.
- **Responsive design**: Guarantee usability across all device sizes and orientations.
- **Microcopy and content strategy**: Use concise, helpful text to guide users.
- **Aesthetic appeal**: Maintain a visually pleasing, brand-aligned look while prioritizing usability.
